/*
If we want to access the address of a memory bucket we can use 
the Address-of operator.
Symbol of the Address of operator:
&(Ampersand).

Operator are the special symbol that performs the operations with the operands.

for example :
int x=10;
now we want to address of the x in the memory 
then we an simply access this with the help of & operator.
int x=10;
cout<<&x;


Why the address of the memory changed everytime we run the program ?
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int x=10;
    cout<<&x; //0x1ffc7ff8bc
    return 0;
} im talking BITU THIS?

In your provided code, you're printing out the memory address of the variable x using the & operator. The output 0x1ffc7ff8bc is the memory address where the variable x is stored during the execution of your program.

However, why you're seeing different memory addresses when you run the program multiple times can be explained by a few factors:

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR): Many operating systems use ASLR to randomize the starting address of programs and their memory regions, including the stack and heap. This is a security measure to make it harder for attackers to exploit memory vulnerabilities. As a result, the memory address of x may change between different runs of the program.

Compiler and Optimization: Compilers may generate different executable code each time you compile your program, especially if optimizations are enabled. This can lead to different memory layouts and addresses.

System Load and Memory Fragmentation: The memory available to a program can vary depending on the system's load and memory fragmentation. This can affect the specific memory address assigned to x.

Runtime Environment: The runtime environment, including the operating system and other running programs, can influence memory allocation and address assignment.

These factors contribute to the variability in memory addresses you observe when running your program multiple times. It's a normal behavior and generally not something to be concerned about unless you have specific requirements regarding memory addresses.


what is the meaning of extracting the value?
ChatGPT
"Extracting the value" typically refers to retrieving the stored data from a variable, data structure, or object. It's the process of accessing and obtaining the actual information that is being held in memory.

For example, if you have a variable x with the value 10, extracting the value of x means obtaining the number 10 from the memory location where x is stored.

Here's a simple example in C++:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x = 10; // Variable x holds the value 10
    int extractedValue = x; // Extracting the value of x and storing it in another variable
    cout << "Extracted value of x: " << extractedValue << endl; // Output: Extracted value of x: 10
    return 0;
}
In this example, x holds the value 10. When we assign x to extractedValue, we're extracting the value 10 from x and storing it in extractedValue. Finally, when we print extractedValue, we see the value 10.


Q!=> Can we store this Address?
ans=> Yes, we can store the address with the help of Pointers ,because pointers are 
used to store the address of memory.
if you have to store the  address, then it store in the pointer varibale.

pointers:
data-type*pointers_name;

int*ptr;  -> so using this we can share address of an integer variable.
int*ptr=&x;

float*ptr; -> using this we can store address of a float variable.
float*ptr1=&y;

/* #include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int a=10,b=20;
    int* x=&a;
    int* y=&b;

    cout<<x<<endl<<y<<endl;
    *y=30; //0x1ffc7ff8bc
     //0x1ffc7ff8bc
     cout<<b<<endl;
     cout<<&b<<endl;
    return 0;
}

for accessing the address
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int x=18;
    int y=0;
    cout<<&x<<endl<<&y<<endl;
    return 0;
}
