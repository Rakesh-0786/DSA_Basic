/*Recursion:- let's understand with a story.
A child couldn't sleep, so her mother told a story about a little frog,
who couldn't sleep, so the little frog's mother told a story about a little bear,
who couldn't sleep, so the little bear's mother told a story about a little weasel
-who fell asleep;
and the little bear fell asleep;
and the little frog fell asleep;
and the child fell asleep.

So in Recursion, we try to solve a bigger problem by finding out solution to smaller sub-problems.
We represent these problems in the form  of function and these
function calls itself to solve smaller sub-problems.


PMI-Principle of Mathemematical induction

Example: Prove sum of first N natural no. is N+(N+1)/2
there are three steps to solve this problems:-
1.Base Case
2.Assumption
3.Self Work
