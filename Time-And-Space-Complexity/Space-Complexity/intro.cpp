// Space Complexity:-
/*It is the extra memory space requirement of an algorithm 

when we are talking about the extra memory space that means we are talking about the  space which it put in RAM

Whenever we execute  a program then that program is always Load in the RAM and and a process is formed that mean how many space is taken by the program during the execution of time is 
called the space Complexity.

// What is the meaning of extra space complexity?
In the context of space complexity analysis, "extra space requirement" refers to any additional memory or space used by an algorithm or program beyond what is needed to store the input data. This includes space used for variables, data structures, function calls, recursion stacks, and any other temporary storage required during the execution of the algorithm.

When analyzing space complexity, it's important to consider both the space required by the input data itself (which may vary depending on the problem) and any extra space needed by the algorithm to perform its computations.

For example:

If an algorithm only requires a fixed number of variables regardless of the input size, its space complexity is considered constant or O(1).
If an algorithm needs to create additional data structures such as arrays, lists, or trees, and the size of these data structures depends on the input size, then the space complexity may be linear or even higher.
Recursive algorithms often require additional space for each recursive call, which contributes to their space complexity.
Overall, the "extra space requirement" in space complexity analysis refers to any space used beyond what is necessary to store the input data itself.
