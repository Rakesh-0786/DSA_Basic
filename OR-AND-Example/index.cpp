Example 1: OR (||) Operator
Consider the following code:

cpp
Copy code
int x = 5;
if (x == 5 || x == 10) {
    cout << "x is either 5 or 10" << endl;
}
Here, if x is 5, the condition x == 5 is true, so the overall condition x == 5 || x == 10 is also true. Therefore, the message "x is either 5 or 10" is printed.

No matter what value x holds, the condition x == 5 is evaluated first. If it is true, the second condition x == 10 is not evaluated because the OR operator only needs one condition to be true.

Example 2: AND (&&) Operator
Consider the following code:

cpp
Copy code
int x = 5;
if (x > 0 && x < 10) {
    cout << "x is a positive number less than 10" << endl;
}
Here, if x is 5, both conditions x > 0 and x < 10 are true. Therefore, the overall condition x > 0 && x < 10 is true, and the message "x is a positive number less than 10" is printed.

In this case, if x is 5, both conditions must be evaluated because the AND operator requires both conditions to be true for the overall condition to be true.

Summary:
OR (||) Operator: If the first condition is true, the second condition is not evaluated because the overall result is already determined to be true.
AND (&&) Operator: If the first condition is false, the second condition is not evaluated because the overall result is already determined to be false.
These behaviors are known as short-circuit evaluation and are used to optimize code execution. They are especially useful in situations where evaluating the second condition may result in errors or unnecessary computation.
